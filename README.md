# Media Player

I'm attempting to make some kind of HTML5 radio player here. I'm planning to use this in my car, so it should be pretty and work on mobiles. I'm still working on it. 
## Libraries used
* Vue JS
* MediaElement.js
* FullPage.js
## Information
Project currently available at https://xshteff.github.io/MediaPlayer/. Please be aware that it's built to look pretty only in landscape mode and the project is not finished yet.
